6. Click `Install`
7. Once installed, close the `Community Plugins` window

1. Download the latest release of the plugin from the [Releases](https://github.com/HeroBlackInk/ultimate-todoist-sync-for-obsidian/releases) page.
2. Extract the downloaded zip file and copy the entire folder to your Obsidian plugins directory.
3. Enable the plugin in the Obsidian settings.


## Configuration

1. Open Obsidian's `Settings` window
2. Select the `Community plugins` tab on the left
3. Under `Installed plugins`, click the gear icon next to the `Ultimate Todoist Sync` plugin
4. Enter your Todoist API token


## Settings
1. Automatic synchronization interval time
The time interval for automatic synchronization is set to 300 seconds by default, which means it runs every 5 minutes. You can modify it yourself.
2. Default project
New tasks will be added to the default project, and you can change the default project in the settings. 
3. Full vault sync
By enabling this option, the plugin will automatically add `#todoist` to all tasks, which will modify all files in the vault.


## Usage

### Task format

| Syntax | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
|#todoist|Tasks marked with `#todoist` will be added to Todoist, while tasks without the `#todoist` tag will not be processed.If you have enabled Full vault sync in the settings, `#todoist` will be added automatically.| `- [ ] task #todoist`|
| 📅YYYY-MM-DD | The date format is 📅YYYY-MM-DD, indicating the due date of a task. | `- [ ] task content 📅2025-02-05 #todoist`   <br>Supports the following calendar emojis.📅📆🗓🗓️|
| #projectTag | New tasks will be added to the default project(For example,  inbox .), and you can change the default project in the settings or use a tag with the same name to specify a particular project. | `- [ ] taskA #todoist` will be added to inbox.<br>`- [ ] taskB #tag #testProject #todoist` will be added to testProject.|
| #tag | Note that all tags without a project of the same name are treated as normal tags | `- [ ] task #tagA #tagB #tagC #todoist` |
|   `!!<number>` | The priority of the task (a number between 1 and 4, 4 for very urgent and 1 for natural).<br>**Note**: Keep in mind that very urgent is the priority 1 on clients. So, the priority 1 in the client corresponds to the number 4 here (Because that's how the official API of Todoist is designed.). | `- [ ] task !!4 #todoist` |

###  Set a default project for each file separately
