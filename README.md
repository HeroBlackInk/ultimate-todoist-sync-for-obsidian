## Usage


### task format
New tasks will be added to the default project, and you can change the default project in the settings or use a tag with the same name to specify a particular project. Tasks marked with #todoist will be added to Todoist, while tasks without the **#todoist** tag will not be processed.

| Syntax | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
|#todoist|Tasks marked with #todoist will be added to Todoist, while tasks without the **#todoist** tag will not be processed.| `- [ ] task #todoist`|
| üìÖYYYY-MM-DD | The date format is üìÖYYYY-MM-DD, indicating the due date of a task. | `- [ ] task content üìÖ2025-02-05 #todoist` <br>Supports the following calendar emojis.üìÖüìÜüóìüóìÔ∏è)|
| #projectTag | New tasks will be added to the default project(For example,  inbox .), and you can change the default project in the settings or use a tag with the same name to specify a particular project. | `- [ ]taskA üìÖ2024-02-04  #todoist` will be added to inbox.<br>`- [ ]taskB üìÖ2024-02-04 #tag #testProject #todoist` will be added to testProject.|
| #tag | Note that all tags without a project of the same name are treated as normal tags | `- [ ] task #tagA #tagB #tagC #todoist` |
|   `!!<number>` | The priority of the task (a number between 1 and 4, 4 for very urgent and 1 for natural).<br>**Note**: Keep in mind that very urgent is the priority 1 on clients. So, the priority 1 in the client corresponds to the number 4 here (Because that's how the official API of Todoist is designed.). | `- [ ] task !!4 #todoist` |

###  Set a default project for each file separately

The default project in the setting applies to all files. You can set a separate default project for each file using command.

### Syncing Tasks

For the automatic synchronization function that has been completed, the plugin will automatically detect it in edit mode. However, some plugins, such as Kanban, may modify the view and cause automatic synchronization to fail, requiring manual clicking of the Sync Button.
